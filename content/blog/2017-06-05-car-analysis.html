<div id="welcome" class="section level1">
<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to my first blog post! This is a walkthrough of R markdown using the base R mtcars dataframe. The following 5 cars were randomly generated using this code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mtcars[runif(5,min=1,max=20),]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                     mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
## Merc 280           19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4
## Cadillac Fleetwood 10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4
## Honda Civic        30.4   4  75.7  52 4.93 1.615 18.52  1  1    4    2
## Merc 450SLC        15.2   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00  0  0    3    3
## Merc 450SLC.1      15.2   8 275.8 180 3.07 3.780 18.00  0  0    3    3</code></pre>
<div id="hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>My basic hypothesis is that car manufacturers seek to maximize all available technology. This implies that the power to weight ratio of cars with similar engine specifications should consistently hit a maximum asymptote. Let us test that hypothesis using engine cylinder as a proxy for engine limitations.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>ggplot(data=mtcars, aes(x=wt, y=hp)) +
  geom_point(alpha=0.5) +
  facet_wrap(~cyl) +
  geom_smooth(method=lm)</code></pre>
<p><img src="/blog/2017-06-05-car-analysis_files/figure-html/unnamed-chunk-1-1.png" width="672" /></p>
<p>As can be observed, the hypothesis has been disproved. There is too much scattering to suggest that the line of best fit in this diagram represents a maximum production possibility frontier. Instead, manufacturers are probably optimising to fit specific clientele rather than pushing a technological limit.</p>
