<h1>Welcome</h1>
<p>Welcome to my first blog post! This is a walkthrough of R markdown using the base R mtcars dataframe. The following 5 cars were randomly generated using this code.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>mtcars[runif(5,min=1,max=20),]</code></pre>
<pre><code>##                      mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb
## Cadillac Fleetwood  10.4   8 472.0 205 2.93 5.250 17.98  0  0    3    4
## Merc 450SE          16.4   8 275.8 180 3.07 4.070 17.40  0  0    3    3
## Valiant             18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1
## Lincoln Continental 10.4   8 460.0 215 3.00 5.424 17.82  0  0    3    4

<div id="hypothesis" class="section level2">
<h2>Hypothesis</h2>
<p>My basic hypothesis is that car manufacturers seek to maximize all available technology. This implies that the power to weight ratio of cars with similar engine specifications should consistently hit a maximum asymptote. Let us test that hypothesis using engine cylinder as a proxy for engine limitations.</p>
<p>As can be observed, the hypothesis has been disproved. There is too much scattering to suggest that the line of best fit in this diagram represents a maximum production possibility frontier. Instead, manufacturers are probably optimising to fit specific clientele rather than pushing a technological limit.</p>
